        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi. I am Daniel Cheng. I was born in September, 2006, in Houston TX. When I was 2, I moved to Novi, MI. During the summers of 
            2011 and 2015, I visited Taiwan, the place where my parents were born and grew up.</p>
        <p>I enjoy swimming, math, and studying chemistry. I also have played the violin since I was 5. Now, I also play the Oboe, a 
            double-reeded instrument that is very fun(and hard) to play.</p>
