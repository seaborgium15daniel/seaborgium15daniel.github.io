        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi. I am Daniel Cheng. I was born in September, 2006, in Houston TX. When I was 2, I moved to Novi, MI. During the summers of 
            2011 and 2015, I visited Taiwan, the place where my parents were born and grew up. My mom teaches Mandarin Chinese at 
            Pioneer High School, while my dad is an assosiate professor and teaches electrical engineering at Wayne State University.</p>
        <p>I enjoy swimming, math, and studying chemistry. I also have played the violin since I was 5. Now, I also play the Oboe, a 
            double-reeded instrument that is very fun(and hard) to play.</p>
