   <h3>Bismuth crystals</h3>
   <h2>About the element:</h2>
   <p>Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. A pentavalent post-transition
   metal and one of the pnictogens, it chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth
   may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as
   dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can
   give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element and has one of the lowest values of
   thermal conductivity among metals.</p>
   <h2>Bismuth's History</h2>
   <p>The name bismuth dates from around the 1660s, and is of uncertain etymology.
   It is one of the first 10 metals to have been discovered. Bismuth appears in the 1660s, from obsolete German
   Bismuth, Wismut, Wissmuth (early 16th century); perhaps related to Old High German hwiz ("white"). The New Latin
   bisemutum (due to Georgius Agricola, who Latinized many German mining and technical words) is from the German
   Wismuth, perhaps from weiße Masse, "white mass". The element was confused in early times with tin and lead
   because of its resemblance to those elements. Bismuth has been known since ancient times, so no one person is
   credited with its discovery. Agricola, in De Natura Fossilium (c. 1546) states that bismuth is a distinct metal
   in a family of metals including tin and lead. This was based on observation of the metals and their physical
   properties. Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name tectum argenti, or "silver being made,"
   in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth.</p><p>Beginning with Johann Heinrich
   Pott in 1738, Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman, the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear,
   and Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin. Bismuth was also
   known to the Incas and used (along with the usual copper and tin) in a special bronze alloy for knives. It's name comes 
   from the German 'Bisemutum', a corruption of 'Weisse Masse', or white mass. </p>
   <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
   <p>Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often occurring in its native form, with an
   iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of
   bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges.
   The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different
   wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen,
   bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of
   its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.</p>

<p>No other metal is verified to be more naturally diamagnetic than bismuth. (Superdiamagnetism is a different physical
phenomenon.) Of any metal, it has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe
neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient. It has a high electrical resistivity. When deposited in 
sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is a semiconductor, despite being a post-transition metal.</p>

<p>Elemental bismuth is denser in the liquid phase than the solid, a characteristic it shares with antimony, 
germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, it was long a component 
of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to 
form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.</p>

<p>Though virtually unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth can form distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. It is 
relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 271 °C, so crystals may be grown using a household 
stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.</p>

<p>At ambient conditions bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony,
crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group R3m No. 166), which is often
classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure 
changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the
body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical 
conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure 
equipment.</p>

<h2>The isotopes of Bismuth</h2>
<p>The only naturally occouring isotope of bismuth is Bi-209, which has a half life of 1.9*10<sup>19</sup>years. 
It has an atomic weight of 208.9804 amu.</p>
<p>Other isotopes of bismuth include Bi-210, which has a half-life of 5.012 days and traces of it are found in 
nature, and the synthetic isotopes Bi-207(a half life of 31.55 years), Bi-208(a half life of 3.68*10<sup>5</sup>
years, and Bi-210m, with a half life of 3.04*10<sup>6</sup> years.</p>

<h2>Uses of Bismuth</h2>
<p>Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few
pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand 
uponfreezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually 
low toxicityfor a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an 
increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently about a third of bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.</p>

<h2>Toxicology</h2>
<p>Scientific literature indicates that some of the compounds of bismuth are less toxic to humans via ingestion compared
to other heavy metals, such as lead, arsenic, and antimony, presumably due to the comparatively low solubility
of bismuth salts. Its biological half-life for whole-body retention is reported to be 5 days, but it can remain 
 in the kidney for years in people treated with bismuth compounds.</p>

<p>Bismuth poisoning can occur and has according to some reports been common in relatively recent times. As with 
lead, bismuth poisoning can result in the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva, known as a bismuth line.
 Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for benefit is unclear. </p>
