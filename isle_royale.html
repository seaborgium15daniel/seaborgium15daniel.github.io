        <h3>About the park</h3>
        <p>Located in the middle of Lake Superior, Isle Royale is Michigan's only national park. It covers about 893 square miles of land, or 
        about 2/71 of Lake Superior's area. For more information, click <a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/index.htm" style="color: #FFFFFF">here</a>
        to visit the NPS webpage.</p>

        <h3>History of this National Park</h3>
        <p>Large quantities of copper artifacts found in indian mounds and settlements, some dating back to 3000 B.C., 
           were most likely mined on Isle Royale and the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. The island has hundreds of pits from these 
           indigenous peoples, with most in the McCargoe Cove area. Carbon-14 testing of a charred log found at one of these pits 
           yielded an age of 1,500 B.C. The Jesuit missionary Dablon published an account in 1669-70 of "an island called Menong, 
           celebrated for its copper." Menong, or Minong, was the native term for the island, and is the basis for Minong Ridge. 
           Prospecting began in earnest when the Chippewas relinquished their claims to the island in 1843, starting with many of the 
           original native pits. This activity had ended by 1855, when no economic deposits were found. The Minong Mine and Island Mine 
            were the result of renewed but short-lived activity from 1873 to 1881.</p>

         <p>In Prehistoric Copper Mining in the Lake Superior Region, published in 1961, Drier and Du Temple estimated that over 1.5 
            billion pounds (630,400 t) of copper had been mined from the region. However, David Johnson and Susan Martin contend that 
            their estimate was based on exaggerated and inaccurate assumptions.</p>
