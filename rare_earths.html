    <h1>Rare Earth Elements</h1>
    <p><h2>Introduction</h2>"Scandium, Yttrium, Lanthanum, Cerium, Praseodymium, Neodymium, Promethium, Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium. 
    "Rare" earths is a bit of an oxymoron: cerium (Cm), a rare earth, actually is about as common as copper. (It's the 25th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, if you wanted to know.) However, due to its longest-lived isotope having a half-life of 17.7 years, promethium (Pm), another member of the rare Earths family, is quite rare in the Earth's crust. The rare-earth elements are cerium (Ce), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), holmium (Ho), lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), terbium (Tb), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb) and yttrium (Y). Their use varies from rather common objects like hard-disk drives (dysprosium) and LED lights (lutetium) to more uncommon things like cancer treatments (yttrium) and shark repellent (samarium). They've had a rather short history (compared to wood and stone, not smart watches): the first rare Earth was discovered in 1787, which, if you wanted to associate such an event with a historical year, was the year the American Constitution was signed.
<h2>Uses</h2>They're found in many places: you’d think that they're easy to find and use, but actually, that's not the case. The problem with rare Earths is that they're hard to separate. Think about it as this: a land full of heavily locked treasure chests. Easy to reach, hard to get. They have many uses. Many can be used to make rare-Earth magnets and/or lasers. Many are also used for X-rays and/or nuclear-related things. The concentration of rare Earths in minerals are only changed by geochemical processes. Because of this, rare Earths are frequently used to date fossils. Rare Earths are found on the lanthanides row of the periodic table, with the exception of scandium and ytterium. They originate from two cool sources: either the s-process (which is a series of nuclear reactions) in asymptotic giant branch (a period of star evolution) stars or supernova nucleosynthesis (the production of elements from supernova explosions). However, uranium-238, a natural isotope of uranium, does produce a bit of promethium doing spontaneous fission, which is basically radioactive decay.
<h2>Discovery</h2>The first rare Earths were discovered in 1787 by Carl Axel Arrhenius. He had discovered a black mineral in a quarry near Ytterby, Sweden (in which Yttrium and Ytterbium are named after). The mineral got to Johan Gadolin (in which Gadolinium is named after), who after careful studying managed to yield a then-unknown oxide that he called yttria. The “yttria” then managed to reach Anders Gustav Ekeberg, who managed to isolate beryllium from the “yttria” but didn't really do much else. In 1794, a new mineral from Bastnäs, a mine near Riddarhyttan, Sweden, was discovered. An examination by Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger led to the discovery of a white oxide, which the duo called “ceria”. Then in 1839, Carl Gustav Mosander managed to separate ceria by heating the nitrate in nitric acid. He discovered an oxide of the soluble salt, which he named lanthana. (The lanthana would eventually become lanthanum.) After three years, he managed to separate the lanthana into something he named didymia. The next year, Mosander separated the yttria into pure yttira, terbium (the earth giving pink salts), and erbium (the earth giving yellow peroxide). In 1878, Per Teodor Cleve discovered holmium and thulium in erbium oxide. Actually, it was Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine that first noticed holmium during an analysis. Then in 1879, Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated samarium from samarskite, a mineral that was discovered in Russia in 1839. The samarskite was then separated some more by the same man, who discovered a new rare earth, which he and Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac (who had produced a similar result trying to separate samarskite) named gadolinium. That same year, Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered scandium in gadolinite and euxenite, a brownish black mineral. Also in that year, ytterbium was discovered by Jean Charles Galiisard de Marignac while examining samples of gadolinite. Then in 1885, Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated neodymium and praseodymium from didymium. It was not isolated in pure form until 1925, though. In 1886, Lecoq de Boisbaudran identified dysprosium by separating it from erbium ores, but it was not isolated in pure form until the 1950s. Between 1886 and 1901, William Crookes, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and Eugene-Anatole Demarçay analyzed samarskite and yttria to find that a new element, which they named europium, was present.  After a few years, in 1907, Georges Urbain, Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James found a new element, which they named lutetium, in Ytterbia in their separate tests. Ytterbia was originally thought to consist purely of ytterbium. Finally, promethium was discovered in 1942, which, surprisingly, is 35 years from the last discovery." <i>From Rare Earths, by Eric Ma</i></p>
